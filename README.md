# React Relay Example

Example for building React App with Relay, React-router and React-bootstrap.
This project also includes an dev server and a GraphQL server.

## Installation

```
npm install
```

## Running

Start graphQL server:

```
npm start
```

## Developing

Any changes you make to files in the `websrc/` directory will cause the server to
automatically rebuild the app and refresh your browser.

If at any time you make changes to `server/schema.js`, stop the server,
regenerate `server/schema.json`, and restart the server:

```
npm run update-schema
npm run dev
```
